# game-client

- This repo contains all the client-side code for the game (dubbed Maze Runner) that I am creating.
- This repo is meant to be used in conjunction with the game-server repo.
- In the application's current state, we have the play-with-friend, play-with-random lobby mechanisms, random maze generation, player movement working.
- The lobby has been designed to some extent. Controls and rules need to be added and the CSS needs significant work but it isn't a priority right now.
- The client-side uses babylonjs, a graphics engine using WebGL for all of the graphics that you will see here.

# Instructions for use
- Clone both this and the server repo
- Open the directories and run 'npm install' in both of them to download all dependencies
- Run 'npm start' in both directories to launch the app
- By default, the app will be accessible through http://localhost:3000
