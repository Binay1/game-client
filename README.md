# game-client

- This repo contains all the client-side code for the game that I am creating.
- This repo is meant to be used with the game-server repo.
- In the application's current state, we have the play-with-friend, random maze generation mechanisms working.
- The client-side uses babylonjs, a graphics engine using WebGL for all of the graphics that you will see here.
